    This class uses an OpenAI language model (LLM) to evaluate whether an agent

    observations. It keeps track of both command milestones (specific tasks) 
    and stage milestones (overall progress).

        evaluator (instructor.client.Instructor): The OpenAI LLM client
        model (str): The LLM to use (gpt-4o)
        reached_milestones (int): The current number of reached command milestones
        command_milestones (list): The loaded command milestones of the task
        stage_milestones (list): The loaded stage milestones of the task


    Methods:
        _evaluate(step, milestone): Call the LLM to evaluate the step
